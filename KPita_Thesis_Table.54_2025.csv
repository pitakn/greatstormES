The demand is underpinned and maintained by having London on the doorstep of the Chilterns, and several large towns in the hills themselves and centres like Oxford, Aylesbury and Milton Keynes (see Fig. 1).

He surveyed his Essex estate when it was returned to him after its service years as an aerodrome and found that what had been land very well endowed with enormous trees in hedgerows and copses was now bare of any noteworthy stature. His immediate reactions were, he said, that however much he could now plant trees, he would never possess the huge and venerable specimens that he admired. “No use moaning about it here.

"Ancient trees provide a variety of ecosystem services, alongside their intrinsic value (see Lindenmayer and Laurence 2017, etc.). In the context of this review, veteran and ancient trees are defined as the ecosystem service itself, which has intrinsic value to people, rather than being the provider of other ecosystem services. These benefits are already captured in the other ecosystem services appearing in this table (and were coded as such).",,,,,,,,
